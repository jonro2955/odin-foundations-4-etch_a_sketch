# Etch-A-Sketch
This is the fourth project from The Odin Project's web develpment foundations curriculum. Link to live version:  

It is a virtual a Etch-a-sketch drawing toy with some extended functionalities using html, css and javascript. The main objective of this project is to put the document object model and javascript events knowledge to practice.   

What I learned:
- How to create dynamic webpages by creating functions that construct html strings that can then be placed as inner html inside DOM elements to create more elements. In this way, it is possible to create entire websites dynamically using only javascript. 
- Adding event listeners, and listening for multiple events in one element. 
- Converting hex colour codes to to rgb.
- DOM, element and style manipulation using javascript.
- Using html color input elements.
- Adding additional functionalities by creating extra variables to store default, current, and previous values, and making correct data transitions in functions. This is important if you want multiple functionalities where turing one on requres automatically turning the others off to ensure that there are no unexpected behaviours.
